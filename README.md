My own zsh configuration divided into separate files to enhance overall organization and ease of understanding.

In order to make this work create .zshrc file in home directory and source those files. P10K should be on top for initial loading.

Antigen needs to be installed on the system
```
sudo apt-get install zsh-antigen
```
